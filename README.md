# Airline-Data-Analysis

## Business Problem 

Airline companies operate a diverse fleet of airplanes from small jets to medium sized 
ones and have been offering good quality air travel services for a long time. Their 
primary goal is to make sure passengers have safe and comfortable, and convenient 
flights. But now they are facing challenges due to various factors like  
1. New environmental rules are stricter 
2. Taxes on flights have gone up 
3. Increase Interest rates (so borrowing money is more expensive) 
4. Fuel prices have increased 
5. It’s harder to find workers in a tight labour market as wages rising  

As a result, it is harder for airlines to earn good revenue. To solve this, they want to look 
at their data and figure out how to fill more seats on each flight (increase the 
“occupancy rate”). If more seats are sold per flight, they can make more profits from 
each trip and improve their overall profits.
